# PhD Pathways

## Introduction

Welcome to my second project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS while incorporating interactive features using JS.



Welcome to the my first project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS only.

PhD pathways is a project focused on providing academics, with a particular focus for PhD students.

User will be able to navigate throught the website using a functional navigation bar. The website will include a careers section, positive testimonials from PhD graduates and a support section where visitors are able to click to explore resources available to them.

## UX - User Experience Design

The 5 planes of UX are the following:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

### The Strategy Plane

1. Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want a webpage to be easy to naviagte.

- As a creator, I want the webpage to be user-friendly and responsive. 

- As a creator, I want users to feel excited about the journey ahead, convey positive vibes, and mitigate anxious feelings.

2. User stories

- As a user, I want to navigate easily through the different sections of the webpage.

- As a user, I want content to be clear, I want links to work well and to take me content that I want to be interested in.

### The Scope Plane.

For the website there were features I wanted to implement and other I was not able to achieve within the deadline.

**Features implemented upon webpage release**

- Header with a functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.

- A careers sections showing some of the options available to PhD graduates and hopefully highlighting the wide range of possibilities available.

- A testimonial sections including people's experiences having made the transition outside of academia in an attempt to convey ease and courage on the visitor.

- A support section including links to material available online to help them achieve their desired goals.

- A sign up page for users to inform on what resources they feel they would find helpful.

- A button to take the user back to the home page after filling out the contact form.

- Footer with links to social media.

### The Skeleton Plane

The more I worked on the project the more than some ideas developed while others were removed.

Header wireframes
--------------------
- The navigation bar has been moved to the left side on mobile devices to keep the navbar tidy and more user-friendly.
- The elements on the navigation bar will direct the user towards the section of interest to make the website more user-friendly.

Resource wireframes
--------------------
- The careers and support content has been displayed as an in-line block for easier visualization and access.
- The header in testimonials is displayed on the right and left of the page alternatively in an attempt to keep user engage by having something slightly different. 
- The support section have links displayed below the images shown which will direct the user towards the content that hopefully will find useful.

#### Bugs and Fixes

1. Display of support elements as an in-line block while positioning the text just below kept failing across different screen resoultions.

- Resolved by adjusting padding, margin and width of different elements accordingly across all screens.

2. The button to return home on my submit form was appearing as a bug on the HTML validator due the button element appearing as a descendant of the a element.

![alt text][bug-readme]

[bug-readme]: ./assets/css/images/bug-readme.png

- I learnt that a button was needed in that scenario and the anchor element was sufficient. The issue was resolved my removing the button element.


### Unfixed bugs

No unfixed bugs.
